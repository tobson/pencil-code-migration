This is a collection of scripts that I used to migrate the Pencil Code from
Google Code to GitHub.

The file `authors.txt` is available
[here](https://github.com/pencil-code/authors).

The Python script `wiki2gfm.py' and the Python module `impl' are available
from [this](https://code.google.com/p/support-tools.git) Git repository.
